# PHP Excercises

In this repository I'm gonna implement some design principles and good practices with PHP.

In the first version I'll not use any framework or lybrary, only the default functions in PHP.

Feel free to post an Issue if you think that something is not right.

## Running the project

Enter the `web` page and run the following comando to start the PHP development server in the port `8080`.

```bash
php -S localhost:8080
```
